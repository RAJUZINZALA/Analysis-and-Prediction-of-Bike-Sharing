Project Description: Analyze bike-sharing data to understand key trends, identify significant factors affecting bike usage, and build a predictive model to forecast future demand. Special emphasis will be placed on comparing bike rentals on weekends versus weekdays. This project will involve data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, feature engineering, and building both regression and classification models using Python.

Summary of Findings:
The distribution of bike rentals shows a right skew, indicating that most days have a moderate number of rentals, with a few days having very high rentals.
The average bike rentals on weekends are higher than on weekdays.
This suggests that people are more likely to rent bikes for leisure activities on weekends.
Correlation analysis shows a strong positive relationship between temperature and bike rentals, and a negative relationship between humidity and bike rentals.
Monthly and seasonal trends indicate higher bike rentals during warmer months and specific seasons.

Model Performance:
The linear regression model showed an R2 score of 0.38, indicating that it explains 37.59% of the variance in bike rentals.
The random forest regressor performed better, with a higher R2 score and lower MAE and MSE values.

Actionable Insights:
Focus on promoting bike-sharing during warmer months and seasons.
Bike-sharing companies can use this information to adjust their pricing and marketing strategies to target weekend riders.
Optimize bike availability and maintenance during peak times identified from the data.
Use the predictive model to forecast demand and adjust the number of bikes available accordingly.
